    <h2>About Our Library</h2>
    <p>
        Reading is the gateway to knowledge and imagination.  
        Our school library is a place where dreams begin through books.  
        We believe every student should have access to inspiring stories,  
        powerful lessons, and endless adventures found within pages.  
        Knowledge is power — and books are the key.
